Solar flare analysis research for PHYS1140 experimental physics class with Dr. James Mason. The goal of this research was to calculate total energy and compare 
our results with the rest of the class and previous semesters. My group downloaded data collected by the GOES-15 satellite from the Space Weather Data Portal 
and chose a relatively clean C-class flare to analyze. Our calculated baseline was almost negligible. We used Pandas and Numpy libaries for our calculations of the
baseline and total energy. We used Matplotlib to plot and visualize our data.
